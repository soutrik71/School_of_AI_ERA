# Project Structure

This project consists of several Python files aimed at organizing code related to a machine learning model.

## Files:

### `model.py`

This file contains the definition of the machine learning model. It includes the architecture of the model, as well as any custom layers or functions necessary for its operation.

### `utils.py`

The `utils.py` file contains utility functions that are used throughout the project. These functions may include data preprocessing utilities, evaluation metrics, or any other helper functions needed for various tasks.

### `train_utils.py`

`train_utils.py` is dedicated to containing utility functions specifically related to training the machine learning model. This may include functions for loading training data, defining training loops, and computing training metrics.

## Notebooks:

### `S5.ipynb`

This Jupyter notebook (`S5.ipynb`) serves as the main entry point for the project. It contains the code for training and evaluating the machine learning model defined in `model.py`. Additionally, it may include data visualization, analysis, and any other exploratory tasks related to the project.
